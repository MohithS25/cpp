=>BASIC COMMANDS:-
 -endl : Used to end the line and move to the next line (flush + \n)
 -flush: Doesn't end line and allows user to continue in same line
 -cout: It is used to output the result
 -cin: It is used to input any value or used to input data 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES:-

=>Building blocks of programming languages

=>Ex:
    int number = 5;
      int is a keyword(datatype)
      number is the variable name 
      5 is value assigned to variable

=>Naming a variable:
  -A variable name cannot start with a number
  -If a variable name has two words it should be separated with an underscore(_)

=>Variables can operated upon by mathematical operators
=>Value of a varible can be reassigned
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRINGS:-
=>Keyword used is string
=>String is declared in double quotes ""
=>Ex:
     string text = "This is a string";
       string is the class
       text is the object which stores the string
=>A string is generally used to store text
=>Strings can be concatinated
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=>DATA TYPES:-
 ->Integer(int):
   -Header file used is 'limits'
   -Keyword used is 'int'
   -Allocates 4 bytes in memory
   -Objects used with int:
     sizeof: Gives the number of bytes allocated in memory
     INT_MAX: Gives the maximum number/value int datatype can store
     INT_MIN: Gives min number/value int datatype can store
     long int: Used to input very large integer values more than what can be
               stored using int(long int allocates 8 bytes in memory)
     short int: Used to input very small integer values(allocates 2 bytes)
     signed int: Can be used to insert both -ve and +ve values
     unsigned int : Used to assign only +ve values
